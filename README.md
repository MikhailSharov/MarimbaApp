#MARIMBA

Marimba is a web app [to be on mobile in the future] designed to help friends share music with each other.
Powered by: Firebase (backend), SvelteKit (front end), TailwindCSS (CSS Styling)

Firebase was chosen as this is my first app and I wanted a complete backend solution with a database (Firestorm) and authentication.
SvelteKit was chosen due to the ease with which it handles reactive data and the simplicity of typing it.
TailwindCSS was chosen as I do not yet have a fantastic grasp on direct CSS handling, so and inline format was ideal.


The project is solo-developed by Mikhail Sharov

Some future features to be included (this is very WIP):

* Firebase Authentication
* Spotify redirect / API inclusion
* Friend sharing feed and streaks
* etc.

The app will be regularly updated as a side-project so stay tuned!
